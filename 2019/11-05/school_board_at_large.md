# Vote: Tay Anderson

Tay Anderson's platform is entirely aligned with my values, and it's also by far the most specific platform. Neither of the other candidates say anything I actively disagree with, but that's mostly because they're not really saying much.

## Why:

| Issue                                 | Anderson | Manuntseva | Menocal Harrigan |
