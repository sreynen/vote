# Vote: Yes

## Why:

I don't have strong feelings about sports gambling, and more money for water conservation seems good. The opposition to this seems concerned the money will be used to make the water situation worse, not better. With most environmental organizations in favor, and only one opposed, I'm assuming that concern is unfounded.
