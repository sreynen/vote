# [2019-11-05 Election](README.md), Proposition CC

## Text

Without raising taxes and to better fund public schools, higher education, and roads, bridges, and transit, within a balanced budget, may the state keep and spend all the revenue it annually collects after June 30, 2019, but is not currently allowed to keep and spend under Colorado law, with an annual independent audit to show how the retained revenues are spent?

# Vote: Yes

## Why:

While I would prefer allocate the money slightly differently, I generally like the idea of the state having more money to provide better services for its citizens.
