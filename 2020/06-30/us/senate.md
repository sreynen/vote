# [2020 Colorado Primary](../README.md), U.S. Senator

## Candidates:

* John Hickenlooper
* Andrew Romanoff

## Information:

* https://andrewromanoff.com/
* https://hickenlooper.com/

# Vote: Andrew Romanoff

## Why:

* Romanoff supports [Medicare for All](../../../values/universal_health_care.md), Hickenlooper does not.
* Romanoff has a more aggressive [climate change](../../../values/minimize_climate_change.md) policy, net zero by 2040 vs. 2050.
* In general, Hickenlooper seems to avoid bold positions while Romanoff embraces them.
