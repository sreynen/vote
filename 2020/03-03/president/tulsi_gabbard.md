## Stance: Lean No

## Why

I agree with Gabbard on many issues, such as Medicare for All and raising the minimum wage. But on many other issues, I range between strong disagreement (e.g. she favors the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism", whereas I believe that phrase encourages xenophobia and war) and distrust that she will engage effectively when needed (e.g. she's supposedly no longer anti-gay, but would she actively protect gay rights if needed? I doubt it.)
