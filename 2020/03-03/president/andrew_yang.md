## Stance: Lean Yes

## Why

Yang's positions generally agree with my values. I worry a bit that he seems very focused on simple solutions, which either leaves him with nothing to say on problems with more complex solutions or causes him to over-simplify the problem to allow for unrealistic solutions.
