## Stance: Lean No

## Why

Hickenlooper doesn't yet have clear positions on most issues, and has pushed back against adopting clear positions like Medicare for All or Green New Deal, while saying he agrees with the general principles. He may still take some positions that entice me to support him, but having lived with him as my Governor, I don't expect it.
