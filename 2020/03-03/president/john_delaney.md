## Stance: Lean No

## Why

Delaney was the first to declare his candidacy and that seems to be the most interesting thing about his candidacy. His announcement op-ed and website are both very focused on bipartisanship, which seems like a bad place to focus at a time when the Republican party has completely failed to hold Trump accountable while he does terrible things.
