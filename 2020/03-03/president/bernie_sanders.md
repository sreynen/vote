## Stance: Lean Yes

## Why

Sanders is a strong advocate for many issues I support. I'm disappointed he's been dismissive of reparations and relatively silent as his supporters have been widely dismissive of the impact of voters on the 2016 election. Both of those make me less enthusiastic about Sanders than I was in 2016, but I'm still mostly a supporter.
