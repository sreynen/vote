## Stance: Lean No

## Why

O'Rourke looks good on some issues, but he's not really the best on anything and he's totally wrong on some issues. He's good on issues that have popular support only _after_ those issues have popular support, so he's not pushing the debate forward. And on issues that don't get much attention, such as military spending, he supports the status quo.
