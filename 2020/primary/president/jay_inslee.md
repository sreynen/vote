## Stance: Lean No

## Why

I may change my mind on Inslee as he releases more policy proposals, but so his positions are a mix of unclear and insufficient. He seems to be focusing his campaign on climate change but he doesn't yet have a climate change plan, and he only gave tepid support for the strongest proposal anyone else has made, Green New Deal.
