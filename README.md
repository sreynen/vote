# Vote

This is a description of how I plan to vote, and why (see [values](values/README.md)). If you'd like to change my mind on anything, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. You're also welcome to fork this repo to plan your own votes.

Upcoming elections:

* [2020 Primary (date TBD)](2020/primary/README.md)
* [November 3, 2020](2020/11-03/README.md)

Past elections:

* [May 7, 2019](2019/05-07/README.md)
* [November 6, 2018](2018/11-06/README.md)
